**THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED**
THE RASPBERRY PI 3 AND NEWER VERSIONS OF RETROPIE HAVE MADE THIS PROJECT NO LONGER RELEVANT TO TODAY'S NEEDS.
HOWEVER, ANYONE WHO WISHES TO CONTINUE TO USE TriPi ON THEIR RASPBERRY PI 2'S ARE ENCOURAGED TO DO SO, AS I WILL NOT BE DELETING THIS REPO-- THOUGH TriPi IS NO LONGER BEING DEVLEOPED, NOR MONITORED BY ME.

I THANK ALL OF YOU WHO MADE USE OF AND ENJOYED THIS PROJECT, AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPERS OF RETROPIE, KODI, AND XBOXDRV.
